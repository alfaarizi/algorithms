Recursions
- a way to solve problem by solving smaller subproblems, it is a function that calls itself to solve a problem
 
NOTE: other definition: a way to solve problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem

Things to consider:
1. Make input smaller
2. Decision space
3. Recursive tree â€“ soul of recursion
4. 2 steps to solve any recursive problem

Simple steps to solving any recursive problem:
1. What's the simplest possile input? => Base case (the only input we provide explicit answer, all solutions build on this)
2. Play around and visualize
3. Relate hard cases to simpler cases



When trying to figure out loop patterns, ask yourself a few questions first.
1. What's changing at each iteration?
   Is it an index going up, pointers moving aroujnd, or maybe items getting pulled off a stack?
   That changing thing usually becomes your function parameter in recursion
2. Look at when the loop stops
   That's your best case
3. Notice if you're building up some result as you go (like a sum) or just doing stuff without collecting anything
   That tells you whether you need to combine return values or just make simple recursive calls
